Eigen is a robust C++ library for  
linear algebra 
Matrix, Array and vector operations
Geometrical/space transformations
Computing Derivatives/ Jacobians
Solving numerical problems such as linear and non-linear regression and least square.


Pure header library. Eigen is implemented using the expression templates metaprogramming technique
meaning it builds expression trees at compile time and generates custom code to evaluate these




In this video series I will show you how you can use it in your applications such that you can perfom numpy style 
operations on your data while benefiting from efficent and speed of c++.

The follwoing will be the outline of this video seroius

At first, Installation and  and adding it to yoru project.


In the second episode I will introduce Matrix Class Vactor Class Array Class, why we have three classes, where we need them 
and how can convert them.  Whats the meaning of classes like 

Then I will continue on  how to initilize matrices and access the Accessing Elements (Coefficient)
What is the difference between row maje and column major, how can we access a block of data and so on
The last part of the second episode will be about Reshaping/ Resizing/ slicing 



In the third episode I will introduce you with Matrix Operations,  matrix and array manipulation
basically Matrix Arithmetic and Coefficient-Wise Operations

In the fourth episode you will get familiar with Advanced Operations with Eigen such 
Memory Mapping
Unary Expression
Eigen Functor
Align



IN the fifth episode you will introduced to Dense Linear Problems And Decompositions
How to solve linear system Ax=B
QR
Computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Rank-revealing decompositions
